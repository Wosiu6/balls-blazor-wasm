# Bouncing Balls Simulation

This project is a **physical simulation of bouncing balls**, built with **C\#** and a **Blazor WebAssembly** frontend. It provides an interactive environment to observe ball collisions and rebounds. You can adjust various settings to see how they impact the simulation.

-----

## Features

  * **Physics Engine**: Simulates realistic (not really, it's 2d) ball collisions and bouncing.
  * **Customizable Settings**: Adjust parameters like the number of balls, size, mass, gravity, and elasticity.
  * **Interactive Interface**: A Blazor WASM frontend allows for real-time adjustments and visualization.
